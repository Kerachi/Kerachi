IMPORTANT:

If you download it make sure, to paste the sfml bin, include and lib folder inside the sfml folder, otherwise it won't work.

If you want to try it out, you can do so by downloading the Debug folder and run the sfml 1.exe.

LESS IMPORTANT:

This is my first SFML game.

I'm working on it on my free time, and I'm using Visual Studio 2017 Community as IDE on Windows 10.

I gladly listen for any suggestion, and do not hesitate to ask about the game or anything else.
