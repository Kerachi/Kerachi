IMPORTANT:
If you download it make sure, to paste the sfml bin, include and lib folder inside the sfml folder, otherwise it won't work.

LESS IMPORTANT:
This is my first SFML game.

I'm working on it on my free time, and I'm using Visual Studio 2017 Community as IDE.

I gladly listen for any suggestion, and do not hesitate to ask about the game or anything else.
