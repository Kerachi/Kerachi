1. Analyze the file with notepad ---> we find which files contain the img file.

At this part I used kali linux:

2. Open Binwalk and run this code:
binwalk -e forensics1.img

This will extract the known file types... (this is not the best way to gain those files from the img file)

3. We got a rar file (and lot of unknown files)

Back to windows from here:

4. Use the RAR Password Unlocker to gain the password to the rar file.(what was 123)
5. Analyze the name of conversation_dtmf.wav file ---> Google for dtmf
6. Upload the file here http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html and the solution form should look like 1234-5678-9ABC-DEFG

After 2-3 weeks excruciating by the time i reached to gain the rar file... the rest was just half hour :D
